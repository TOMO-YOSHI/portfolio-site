## About
This is the portfolio site to showcase my works and skills.

To see this website, please visit https://tomohiroyoshida.com.

## Why I (our team) created this web application
I created the website to understand how to develop website with vanilla JavaScript and related techniques.

I can create a website with conventional technology.<br />
(I have used React to develop websites in other projects. If you would like to see other projects, please vists my works page, https://tomohiroyoshida.com/works.html, and take a look at my other works.)

### Headless CMS

I adopt Contentful (https://www.contentful.com) to manage contents of this website.
